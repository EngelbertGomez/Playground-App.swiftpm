// In this part of the project we will discuss about the "constants".

// let myFirstConstant = "Would you like to be on board?"                           |

// var myFirstConstant = "Would love to go for a trip"                            //|
    print(myFirstConstant)                                                        //|

//In this example we will be able to see that we can't declare a constant twice.    |
//We could either have it deactivated by commenting it or do var instead of let.    |
//A constant's value can't be changed.                                              |

//Another constant example:                                                         |
