// ######### Physics excersise. ################

// Hello! this is going to be a physics formula excersise, for this is one, we will begin with the speed, time, distance one.

// we will first give format them.

let Speed = 20          // In this example we got that the speed value it's 20km/h.
 let Time = 5          // In this example we got that the time value it's 5 hours.
  let Distance = 100  // In this example we got that the distance value it's 100km.
   var Car = "BMW M3"

// after this, we will apply the conceps already known.

// Speed formula
print("The speed of the", Car, "during the travel was", Distance/Time, "kilometers per hours")

  // Time formula
    print("The time took by the", Car, "to reach the destionation was", Distance/Speed, "hours")

   // Distance formula
     print("The distance traveled by the", Car, "was", Speed*Time, "kilometers")







                        // Â¡ANOTHER EXCELLENT JOB, WE'LL see more of these in the future!


// ... TO DO  ######  !

//  ######## Addiontal questions... (?) ########

// What was the total distance traveled by the BMW at 75 kilometers? (give your answers in meters)
