/* Hello Engel, this is SWIFT BASICS... 
 
 You are going to be able to learn the basics of the programming language "SWIFT",
 please have any material extracted, and any future knowledge stick to this page,
 this will help us in the future if needed.

// We have different data types, as you already know or have
// experienced in the past with other languages you've worked with such as:
// Python, Java and C#, let's jump right into it...


//This is how we define/declare a variable as an STRING type in swift:

var myFirstVariable = "hello Engel"

//The function "print", well known between mutliple languages...

print(myFirstVariable) // The preview of each code line will be available in this side ----->



//This is how we define/declare a variable as an INT type in swift:

var myFirstNumber = 1

var mySecondNumber = 2

myFirstNumber + mySecondNumber 

//Opperation successed you were to SUM the first and second "INT" variables...

 You already know this but just as a reminder...                                          |
 we can not assign an Int type variable to an String one.                                 |
 (Well... you can not assign a different variable type between any of them.)              |
                                                                                          |
